    <p><strong class="text-amber-100">I'm a designer and developer</strong> and have been, full-time, since 2006.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">Builder of websites, web applications and APIs.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">As at home discussing clients' needs as sketching user journeys on paper, doing photography, creating layouts and writing code. Always trying to do new things, or old things in new ways. Striving for self improvement though efficiency and clear communication.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">I've designed and built everything from single page applications, to internal-use systems that benefit in-house efficiency to fully bespoke, themable multi-site e-commerce content management systems with lots of external integrations, meaning I've gained a wide variety of skills in lots of areas.</p>

    <h3 class="font-headings text-2xl mt-6">The tech I use</h3>

    <p class="mt-3">I tend to build the backend of a project in PHP on the TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel and Livewire). However, I weigh each project up to decide the requirements so am happy to adapt on a project-by-project basis (for example, this site is built on Hugo with Tailwind and Laravel Mix).</p>

    <h3 class="font-headings text-2xl mt-6">My career</h3>

    <p class="mt-3">Originally from London, as a hobbyist web designer I moved to West Yorkshire in 2001 to attend university. From early 2006, I worked as a developer for a wholesaler for 18 months before moving to my current position which I've held since November 2007.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">Over the past {{ sub (int (now.Format "2006")) 2006 }}+ years, I've developed numerous and continually developing technical skills as well as ways of understanding and interpreting clients' requirements and explaining concepts to stakeholders in clear ways.</p>

    <h3 class="font-headings text-2xl mt-6">Outside of work</h3>

    <p class="mt-3">I regularly hike, explore new places and indulge in photography. I enjoy music, be it watching live, listening or playing and composing. I am a keen sports fan, watching motorsport, football and playing darts.</p>
